## This application is built for Developing Data Products course project.


This application will solve quadratic equation having the form a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0
Where x represents an unknown, and a, b, and c represent known numbers such that a is not equal to 0.

You should enter coefficients in the input fields.
Coefficients will be used to determine the Discriminant.
